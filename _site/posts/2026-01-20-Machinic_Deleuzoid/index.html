<h1 id="organs-and-the-hierarchical" tabindex="-1">Organs and the Hierarchical</h1>
<p>In the BwO framework, “organs” symbolize the organ-ization that defines the very structure of bodies, systems, and societies. The name “BwO” is itself a sufficient clue to what it is primarily at stake of thought. According to D&amp;G, every organized entity—whether an organism, process, or social system—suffers from being fixed in a particular arrangement. This persistent impulse toward organization is not a flaw but a feature of all living and systemic forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionalism</strong>: Organs exist to serve an overall purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Stratification:</strong> These organs are arranged in a hierarchy that governs the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>D&amp;G criticize this “molar structure” because it solidifies the body into a closed system, limiting its capacity for fluidity. The rigidity is not inherent in the organs themselves but arises from their fixed symbolic assignments and territorial boundaries.</p>
<h1 id="bodies-as-flow-and-assemblage" tabindex="-1">Bodies as Flow, and Assemblage</h1>
<p>Everything in our world, traffic, money, tears, rivers, is composed of flows. In our own bodies, flows of blood, hormones, and waste are constantly moving from one pole (source) to another (destination). These flows, when they connect, form what D&amp;G call <em>partial objects</em> or <em>desiring machines</em>. For example, think of the simple connection made when your mouth touches the tip of a straw to sip a drink. Such partial objects are not whole things like cars or buildings; they are dynamic links that, together, form the basis of D&amp;G’s political–philosophical ontology.</p>
<p>Assemblage, in french <em>agencement</em>, usually translated as “putting together”, “arrangement”, “layout”, or “fitting”. <em>Agencement</em> is not a static term, not the arrangement or organization but the <em>process</em> of arranging and organizing, to assemble. Assemblage is a collection of heterogeneous elements, diverse things brought together in particular relations. The elements also include the <em>qualities</em> present and the <em>affects</em> (情動). Not just what it “is”, also what it “can” do. An example is D&amp;G’s re-reading of a Freud’s case: <em>A child was touched by the sight of a horse pulling a carriage through his window. The horse collapsed in the street and was being whipped by the driver. It was about to die.</em> This scene is an assemblage, horse–omnibus–street, as a collection of objects in a particular relations, it is also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a list of active and passive affects in the context of the individuated assemblage it is part of: having eyes blocked by blinders, having a bit and a bridle, being proud, having a big peepee-maker, pulling heavy loads, being whipped, falling, making a din with its legs, biting, etc. These affects circulate and are transformed within the assemblage: what a horse “can do”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assemblages create territories, more than just spaces: they make stakes, claims and expressions. What do I perceive from you? Chikawaa toys, screaming, violent Angus, cooking meat, chocalate clothes. The traits in this partial description constitute an assemblage, yet they just partially make you up, expressing a certain quality of identity (同一性). The point is that this assemblage does not have to consist of these particular elements. Anthropologists Heather Horst and Daniel Miller once studies about mobile phones in Jamaica:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no fixed thing called a cell phone or fixed group called Jamaicans. Rather, this book will seek to find out what Jamaicans have become in the light of their use of cell phone and what cell phone has become in the light of its use by Jamaicans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assemblages of a mobile phone should also include people elsewhere, becoming private publicly, having an iPhone Pro Max Ultra Super, and what the assemblage does: how it shapes space, transforms behaviour, rings, texting. Here, we encounter the posthumanist shift, that mechanical implants would radically alter our assemblage–cyborg body. Becoming posthuman is more than <em>just</em> installing prosthesis on a pre-becoming biological organic body and expect nothing happens except for the one-dimensional extension or scalar amplification of extant functional organs — a zombie (organs without body). Assemblages are not just things that accumulate together to articulate into formation. Rather than putting an apple in your refrigerator, it is more like a cockroach leg in a pot of lohikeitto (or 皇帝用金鋤頭). We cannot <em>think</em> technology in isolation, taken out of every context respectively. Not an individuated human with an isolated phone, but a body–phone–doomscrolling–etc.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-desire" tabindex="-1">What is Desire?</h1>
<p>Traditional Western philosophy has typically defined desire in terms of what is missing or lacking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plato:</strong> Desire is the impulse to fill a <strong>sense</strong> of void (e.g., hunger as a lack of food).</li>
<li><strong>Kant:</strong> The faculty which by means of its representations is the cause of the actuality of the objects of those representations</li>
<li><strong>Freud:</strong> Desire is driven by repressed instincts (like Oedipus complex).</li>
<li><strong>Lacan:</strong> Desire is the endless chase after the elusive objet-petit-a, the signifier of lack</li>
</ul>
<p>These views share common themes: they all locate desire in the sense of absence, tie it to a subject-centered interiority, and see it as something that must be controlled or sublimated in opposition to social norms.</p>
<p>D&amp;G simply put desire as the production of reality: “desire produces, [and] its product is real”. Unlike Kant’s who distinguishes between pathological–irrational and moral–rational desires, D&amp;G sees desire as both creative and productive before any social structures. Marx describes nature as humanity’s “inorganic body”, yet social representation functions precisely to separate desire from reality. Much like Spinoza’s idea of superstition limiting a body’s potential. This introduces a retroactive injection of so-called “needs” and scarcity into a desire–reality relations that are immediate onto the unconscious, species-being level. Consequently, individuals and groups internalize a sense of deficiency, believing they need something that was, in fact, originally produced by desire but later claimed by the social order.</p>
<p>D&amp;G argue that desire is not merely a reaction to lack but is both a producer and a product—a process they call <em>desire-production</em>. Rather than being confined to the mind or a fixed state of lack, desire is an active, creative force that connects flows and assembles partial objects into ever-changing configurations. For example, A baby feeding at the breast is not driven by “hunger as lack” but is engaging in a desiring-machine process. Mouth-breast assemblage produces flows of pleasure, crying, touching, etc. Similarly, a musician improvising with an instrument allows rhythmic and harmonic disruptions to break away from fixed structures, creating new flows of expression. The journey of learning an instrument requires a significant amount of <em>bare repetition</em>— scales, arpeggios, runnings, etc. Once one reaches a certain level of proficiency, improvisation becomes possible. Free jazz musicians start from a familiar “basin of attractors” (notes and chord, tonic, dominant, M7, whatsoever), to the unexpected change of keys, tonal language, while maintaining its consistency as a piece of music. This is an example of <em>de-territorialization</em>. This term is intended to replace schizophrenia. Territorialization is accompanied by processes of coding, de-coding and re-coding: Marriage might de-code an eligible status of bachelor of a young man, and re-code him as a husband not-available. In <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, Marx and Engels described this process as “strips of its halo”—everything with intrinsic value and replaces it with strict quantitative, monetary value. This process of commodification enables exploitation, but also frees desire from being captured by social encodings, releasing huge amounts of free-flowing energy that capital cannot always re-capture for private accumulation. D&amp;G calls this “schizophrenia”, not in the sense of mental illness, but the free, decoded flow of desire. It is the limit of capitalism. However, desire never appears in absolutely pure form, it is always expressed through codes and institutions (Like Lacan’s “Desire is the desire of <em>the <strong>O</strong>ther's</em> desire”).</p>
<p>D&amp;G also critique the psychoanalytic Oedipal model for reducing desire to a “family drama,” arguing that this model—along with capitalist family structures—ignores desire’s decentralized and impersonal character. They expand the discussion by comparing desire to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will to Power (Nietzsche):</strong> An affirmative, life-affirming force</li>
<li><strong>Élan vital (Bergson):</strong> A manifestation of creative evolution.</li>
<li><strong>Conatus (Spinoza):</strong> The fundamental drive for every being to persist in its existence.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, while this posthuman perspective decouples desire from strictly human agency, it raises questions about how agency remains possible when desire is seen as entirely decentralized from human, and it may risk romanticizing escape underestimating structural constraints.</p>
<h1 id="desire-production" tabindex="-1">Desire-Production</h1>
<p>While flows are central to D&amp;G’s thought, the universe is also marked by <em>breaks</em>—points where continuous flows are interrupted and reconfigured. Think of the process of fuel moving through a car engine: it flows from the gas tank to the engine, yet along the way, there are mechanical breaks that convert energy, set pistons in motion, and ultimately get the wheels turning. In our bodies, everyday actions like playing a clarinet, using a touchscreen, or even receiving a paper cut serve as breaks where flows diverge or recombine.</p>
<p>Desiring machines operate through these interruptions. When a car breaks down, it is not the entire machine that fails but the network of partial objects and connections that has been disrupted. D&amp;G describe this as an inherent quality of desire-production: it constantly undergoes exchanges and expenditures through a multitude of connections, which in turn drive its own dissolution—a process they consider “the law of conservation.” While organization restricts the body, desiring machines inherently resist fixation and continuously push toward disintegration.</p>
<p>Before addressing the BwO directly, D&amp;G introduced the concept of the <em>abstract machine</em> in Guattari’s <em>Machinic Unconscious</em>. This abstraction is not the conceptual abstraction of epistemologists, nor Hegelian dialectics, but the deterritorialization. Rather than being tied to a universal time or fixed semiotic properties, the abstract machine is a fluid assemblage of symbol-machines operating across various levels of reality. It establishes and dismantles hierarchies continuously.</p>
<p>Whenever we discuss the abstract machine, we always point to a consistent and horizontal emergence under specific historical conditions. This is the anti-structuralist methodology, never presupposes a transcendent, invariant system (like Lacan’s signifier, Althusser’s ideology or Strauss’ language) or a central series. Some may argue that capitalism always enforces a command centered on the “capital” and organ-izes a complete structure. Yet capitalism too is governed by the abstract machine of power-economic organisation and uses gigantic “molecular” machines to deterritorialize flows. It also arranges “black-holes” along paths. Black-holes are “traps” that reproduce constraining forms of subjectivity, suck-in and aggregate semiotic contents only to re-situate them in a repressive, serialized, hyper-charged form, as to condition desire.</p>
<p>Returning to the body, D&amp;G draw on Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em>, where Spinoza remarks, “We feel that a body [or thing] is affected in manifold ways.” For Spinoza, the mind’s power emerges from bodily sensations and their interplay with the limits of order (<em>affects</em>). The BwO is seen as an “embryo” of intensities—a state of virtual potential that has not yet crystallized into an organized system of organs.</p>
<h1 id="body-without-organs" tabindex="-1">Body-without-Organs</h1>
<p>The BwO should be understood as a real, transformative entity rather than a mere metaphor. By its very nature, it resists a complete, stable description—precisely because it stands in opposition to organized, fixed organisms. D&amp;G propose that beneath every organized body lies a primordial, undifferentiated metaphysical substrate—a body not yet interpellated or disciplined into a fixed subjectivity. In this state, partial objects (breasts, lips, even the anus) press against one another within a field of pure, immanent drives. Organisms experience this primordial body much like a mass of soft, shifting 豆腐花 crawling beneath the skin. It serves as a counterflow to the production of fixed connections—a substrate of primordial fluidity that cannot be penetrated but remains essential to the constitution of desire.</p>
<p>For D&amp;G, Lacan’s objet-petit-a does not stand for “lack”. Precisely that we have lost objet-petit-a, desire can be realized and emancipated into becoming-flow. Repression is necessarily structured; in other words, there is no such thing as <em>primal repression</em>. Or more fundamentally, repression does not exist at all. In psychoanalysis, the attempt to bring unconscious content into consciousness is seen by D&amp;G as a destruction and annihilation of the unconscious, as it “suffocates the production of desire.” They seek to restore the purity of desire—it is not related to lack, nor is there anything that needs to be repressed. However, it (the product) can only exist through the process of assemblage.</p>
<p>The BwO defines a limit of desire’s insistence towards disorganisation. Unlike the production of connections that occurs with desiring machines, BwO is of itself entirely non-production. It simultaneously repulses, attracts the production of connections (the desiring-machines), this antagonism in their attempts to penetrate the BwO produces “paranoiac-machine”. It anti-produces connections. This stands in opposition to the methodologies of psychoanalysis and structuralism, which define desire as “lack” and castrate it, expanding its boundaries until it becomes the primary social value (Althusser’s ideological apparatus is a typical example. It outlines the concrete production of society as a machine, then retreating to re-presentational ideology, thus failing to overcome subjectivity, and only restoring the paranoid psychotic machine).</p>
<p>Capitalism, with its abstract machine, manipulates flows at the level of production by controlling economic-power organizations—not through ideology per se, but the resonant redundancy of the organism where desire is continuously linked, produced, and captured. In this sense, the BwO functions like a “cartography,” constantly redrawn by the movement of abstract machines that sketch lines of flight, black holes, and stratifications of desire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The body without organs is not a body, but a plane of immanence. [...] For the BwO is all of that: necessarily a Place, necessarily a Plane, necessarily a Collectivity (assembling elements, things, plants, animals, tools, people, powers, and fragments of all of these; for it is not &quot;my&quot; body without organs, instead the &quot;me&quot; (moi) is on it, or what remains of me, unalterable and changing in form, crossing thresholds).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in other words, the BwO is the virtual ground of an actual assemblage. It is a reservoir of potentiality. One can’t desire without a BwO; Desire means “wanting to be part of an assemblage”. A completely deterritorialization is inhabitable for organisms, we all need some organization. The reason for D&amp;G to posit the BwO is that they believe if we take the world at face value, one cannot explain how stuff organizes and unorganizes. Transcendental forces are conditions of organization. The BwO allows us to think bodies (animals, the State, language, semiotics, etc.) as radical contingency and potential differences.</p>
<p>D&amp;G warn that the BwO may lead to extreme outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rigified BwO (Cancerous):</strong> Excessive anti-production results in blocked flows (e.g., addiction).</li>
<li><strong>Empty BwO (Paranoiac):</strong> Unchecked escape of flows can trigger schizophrenic breakdowns (e.g., psychedelic-induced delirium).</li>
<li><strong>Generated BwO (Healthy):</strong> A dynamic balance between production and anti-production transforms the body into an open field for experimentation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out continuums of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of new land at all times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within this framework:</p>
<h3 id="bwo-as-the-field-of-intensities" tabindex="-1">BwO as “the field of intensities”</h3>
<p>Flows converge into non-organic intensities—non-expressional forces such as emotion, energy, and sensory resonance that resist capture by fixed semiotics. These intensities emerge when conventional organic functions are suspended, as during extreme experiences (pain, ecstasy, trance, musical climax). They operate at a molecular level, reflecting microscopic differences that oppose the fixed, molar categorizations (like genres or social identities). This is akin to the phenomenon of “起乩”, where divine entities are believed to possess performers during rituals, temporarily transforming their bodies into mere containers of raw intensities and creating “smooth space”—an unstratified plane that allows desire to flow freely.</p>
<h3 id="bwo-as-becoming" tabindex="-1">BwO as Becoming</h3>
<p>Here, “becoming” refers to the constant, unbounded flow of difference production—a process that is about transformation rather than reaching a predetermined destination. Russian revolutionary anarchist, Bakunin writes, being is identified with becoming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be real… is to become…: i.e., movement always and eternally resulting from the infinite sum of all the particular movements down to the infinitely small, the totality of the mutual actions and reactions and the ceaseless transformations of all the things that appear and disappear in turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What we term a molar entity is, for example, the woman as defined by her form, endowed with organs and functions and assigned as a subject… [Becoming-woman is] not imitating or assuming the female form, but emitting particles that enter the relation of movement and rest, or the zone of proximity, of a microfemininity, in other words, that produce in us a molecular woman, create the molecular woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Becoming-woman does not have to do with being a woman, being like a woman or standing in for a woman. Becomings are always molecular deterritorializations, effects destabilizing dominant molar forms and relations. Thus, there is no “becoming-man”, because the molar entity par excellence is “the rational, white, adult, masculine male”. Becomings only resonate to the figure constituted by dualisms around dominant man-image: male/female, adult/child, white/non-white, rational/emotional, masculine/feminine. Both men and women must become-woman.</p>
<h1 id="sado-masochism" tabindex="-1">Sado-Masochism</h1>
<p>BwO can be visualized through sadomasochism. Pain is something to be avoided, something that causes the opposition of pleasure. The sadomasochist has taken their body and actualized one of its potentials, that pain can now be pleasurable, like when Foucault says that the normative/vanilla view of sexuality is not normal in an abstract sense but is merely one of the potentials that has been actualized by society. SM reinvents pleasure, that the antithesis of pleasure (pain) becomes part of its foundation. As Foucault writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sexuality must not be thought of as a kind of natural given which power tries to hold in check, or as an obscure domain which knowledge tries gradually to uncover. It is the name that can be given to a historical construct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D&amp;G extend their analysis to sado-masochism by distinguishing between two modes:</p>
<h3 id="organised-sm-rigid-bwo" tabindex="-1">Organised SM (Rigid BwO)</h3>
<p>In this form, SM is reduced to a master-slave dynamic reminiscent of Freud’s “father-superego.” It reinforces a binary system of pain and pleasure that ultimately serves the rigid symbolic order—a pathology of the organized body.</p>
<h3 id="healthy-bwo" tabindex="-1">“Healthy” BwO</h3>
<p>It escapes (not only by rejection) symbolic structures by dissolving fixity. Such as rejecting the transcendental signifier of phallus in psychoanalysis, or as a symbol of masculinity. The sadist does not seek control over others but aligns with abstract forces; The masochist does not submit but transforms pain into sensory intensity. SM approaches the BwO state of depersonalisation, but with risk being reabsorbed into the symbolic order.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-you-make-youself-a-bwo" tabindex="-1">How do you make youself a BwO?</h1>
<p>This is the title of the fifth plateau of <em>A Thousand Plateus</em>, and the ethic is addressed directly there: <em>Make yourself a BwO, and here’s how to do it.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where psychoanalysis says, &quot;Stop, find your self again,&quot; we should say instead, &quot;Let's go further still, we haven't found our BwO yet, we haven't sufficiently dismantled our self.&quot; Substitute forgetting for anamnesis, experimentation for interpretation. Find your body without organs. Find out how to make it. It's a question of life and death, youth and old age, sadness and joy. It is where everything is played out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everybody has a BwO, or some BwO. A BwO is not a space or a space, it is an occasion for experimenting with intensities, a continuous self-constructing/associating milieu. Meanwhile, desiring-production is by nature indeterminate, as it is subjected to the determination of social institutions and representations. The BwO stages the struggle of desire to escape determination, whether it is instinctual, habitual or social, designated for the human potential for freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question is fundamentally that of the body—the body they steal from us in order to fabricate opposable organisms. This body is stolen first from the girl: Stop behaving like that, you’re not a little girl anymore, you’re not a tomboy, etc. The girl’s becoming is stolen first, in order to impose a history, or prehistory, upon her. The boy’s turn comes next, but it is by using the girl as an example, by pointing to the girl as the object of his desire, that an opposed organism, a dominant history is fabricated for him too. The girl is the first victim, but she must also serve as an example and a trap. That is why, conversely, the reconstruction of the body as a Body without Organs, the anorganism of the body, is inseparable from a becoming-woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Girl, or a Shōjo, would always be a becoming-woman and never become a woman. “One may argue that shōjo constitute their own gender, neither male or female but rather something importantly detached from the productive economy of hetero-sexual reproduction.” The Shōjo is a becoming-molecular, a line of flight. “shōjo means ‘not-quite-female female’” Shōjo, the girl, is an “in-between” (<em>au milieu</em>). &quot;Girls do not belong to an age group, sex, order, or kingdom: they slip in everywhere, between orders, acts, ages, sexes; they produce η molecular sexes on the line of flight in relation to the dualism machines they cross right through” The girl is an experiment, the BwO.</p>
<h1 id="postscript" tabindex="-1">Postscript</h1>
<p>The reason why many couldn’t understand French philosophy properly, is that they never read literature. Say for Proust, Kafka, Joyce, Marllame, … French philosophers especially love to elaborate their notion through analysing specific writers. For example, Foucault on Sade; Lacan on Joyce and Kafka; Deleuze on Kafka and Proust.</p>
<p>Actually, I’m not a fan of the notion “post-structuralist” or “post-poststructuralist” because it contains an inherent paradox: <em>If you truly believe [someone] is a post-structuralist, then they cease to be one.</em></p>
<p>If post-structuralism is understood as a turn toward genealogy, a Hegelian dialectical reversal, or the inscription of unconscious drives, then it is something produced precisely <em>as structuralist internal negation</em>. In this logic, deconstruction is merely a prelude to the dialectical tension between structuralism and post-structuralism (as the antithesis within structuralism). If we accept this formulation, then the very name of “post-structuralism” gains its legitimacy only as a presence emerging from this dialectic.</p>
<p>The real problem arises when we attempt to confine [someone] within a particular theoretical–historical genealogy. Even if this categorization is necessary and inevitable, we must acknowledge that <em>sublimation</em> is at play here. What sublimation? Just like Narcissus withers upon recognizing himself in the mirror, post-structuralism, in the process of evolving itself, encounters structuralism and collapses. What we do is akin to a choir, capturing the <em><strong>traces</strong></em> of this dialectic.</p>
<p>Thus, the significance of psychoanalysis (or any other “post-structuralism”) lies in its ability to demonstrate, through the powerless sighs and desperate wails of failure, how the impossibility inherent in subjectivity becomes visible. If this is the case, then <em>true</em> post-structuralism does not exist. If it did, it would only have two possible tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>to retroactively mark to position of impossibility after a decisive historical rupture;</li>
<li>to show how ideology facilitates our “leap of faith” embracing into meaning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both the tasks, however, ultimately point in the same direction: proving the attempt to exhaust impossibility — only oscillates endlessly between success and failure, just as psychoanalysis demonstrates the history of human desire.</p>
<p>Today, every argument of the structural/post-structuralism divide inevitably produces Derrida-styled discourse, where the chase of <em><strong>traces</strong></em> becomes traces itself. This applies to even contemporary theorists like D&amp;G, who explicitly reject dialectics and psychoanalysis (?). What we continue to repeat is the same process: a compulsive return to an unfinished drive before the future arrives.</p>
<p>This work is, of course, valuable. But we must not confuse one crucial point: the structural/post-structural distinction can only be properly articulated either at the moment when this dialectic is fully resolved, or it can only be that all the post-structuralisms are still not <em>post</em> enough. In this sense, <em>true</em> post-structuralism should serve as the gravestone of our era, if we does not end up in a zombie apocalypse, fallout scenario or ...</p>
