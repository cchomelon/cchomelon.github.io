## Mathematical Model
The 2D shallow water system for the free-surface flow with the Coriolis effect and bottom friction stress is formulated as,

$$
\begin{cases}
\partial_t h + \nabla \cdot (h \mathbf{u}) = 0, \\
\partial_t (h \mathbf{u}) + \nabla \cdot (h \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}) + \frac{1}{2} \nabla (g h^2) = -g h \nabla Z - f_c \times h \mathbf{u} - r(h, \mathbf{u}),
\end{cases}
\tag{1}
$$

where the unknowns are always the water height $h(t,x,y) \geq 0$ and the horizontal speed mean $\mathbf{u}(t,x,y)$. The parameter $f_c$ is linked to the angular speed of the earth's rotation, and $r(h,\mathbf{u})$ is the dissipative term, such as friction, etc. Say for Manning roughness,

$$
r(h,\mathbf{u}) = \eta^2 g h^{-1/3} |\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{u}.
$$

We can also add surface wind effect. The viscosity term for the turbulence closure problem, in this case, the momentum equation of $(1)$ becomes

$$
\partial_t (h \mathbf{u}) + \nabla \cdot (h \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}) + \frac{1}{2} \nabla (g h^2) = -g h \nabla Z - f_c \times h \mathbf{u} - r(h, \mathbf{u}) + \tau(h, \mathbf{\tilde{u}}) + \nu \Delta h \mathbf{u},
\tag{2}
$$

where $\tau=\frac{1}{2} C_D |\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{u}$. For simplicity, we rewrite system $(2)$ in a conservative vectorial form,
